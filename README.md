Weight-to-Height Predictor: A Simple Linear Regression App
This project is a demonstration of a foundational machine learning concept, Simple Linear Regression, packaged into a simple, functional web application. The goal is to predict a person's height based on their weight, showcasing a complete end-to-end machine learning workflow from model training to deployment.

Project Overview
The core of this project is a Linear Regression model. You can think of this model as a tool that finds the straight line which best fits a set of data points (in this case, pairs of weight and height). By finding this line, the model learns the relationship between weight and height, allowing it to make a new prediction when a weight is provided.

This app is designed to highlight key best practices in machine learning, making it a great portfolio piece.

Technologies Used
Python: The primary programming language.

Flask: A lightweight web framework used to create the web app's backend.

Scikit-learn: The machine learning library for building the model (LinearRegression), handling data standardization (StandardScaler), and creating the full workflow (Pipeline).

Pandas & Matplotlib: Used within the Jupyter Notebook for data handling and exploratory analysis.

HTML & Tailwind CSS: For the simple and clean front-end user interface.

Key Learnings
This project taught me several important lessons about building reliable machine learning systems:

The Importance of Standardization: Models like Linear Regression can be sensitive to the scale of your data. For example, if we train the model on data where all values are close to zero, it won't work correctly on new data with much larger numbers. Standardization fixes this by adjusting the data to a common scale, ensuring consistent results.

Using a Pipeline for Consistency: When I first deployed this app, it gave a completely wrong prediction. The reason was that the model was trained on standardized data, but the web app was feeding it raw, unstandardized input. The solution was to use a pipeline, which is a single tool that automatically applies the correct standardization step to any new input before feeding it to the model. This guarantees a consistent and reliable process.

Avoiding Data Leakage: This is a crucial concept that means accidentally "cheating" by letting your model see information from the test data during training. To avoid this, it's essential to split your data into a training set and a test set before you perform any data preprocessing. This ensures your final model evaluation is a true reflection of its performance on new, unseen data.
